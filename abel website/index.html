	<h3>Sustainability - Peace - Luxury</h3>
<hr>
<br>
	<p>I am Abel, many members here at TechShop Crystal City know me, because of the sculptures I have at the reception, and of course the trunks I'm saving from being converted into firewood, mulch or chips.
	
	<br>
	<br>
Everyone who knows me here in the Shop, knows how much a piece of wood means to me, and my passion, deep respect for this magnificent raw material, wood, is because I learned from childhood to transform it into objects that I could use, and little by little I was learning the real meaning of wood.
	<br>
	<br>

For those who do not know me, here a bit of me, I started to work the wood when I was about 5 - 6 years old, first "helping" my grandfather, (he makes tools), and little by little I got to know more of The tools for wood, how they are used and what can be done with very few tools; I was fascinated with my grandfather's workshop.</p>
